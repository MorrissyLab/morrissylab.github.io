<h3 id="postdoctoral-fellow-in-cancer-genomics">Postdoctoral Fellow in Cancer Genomics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Successful candidates will be PhD graduates who are interested in making fundamental discoveries in tumor evolution and immune response that can lead to translational impact in aggressive and largely incurable sarcoma subtypes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research approaches in our team include multi-omic profiling of tumor samples at the bulk and single cell level, paired with functional genomics, mouse modeling, and translational ‘mouse-hospital’ approaches. The project has a direct connection to the clinic and utilizes bio-banked material as well as prospectively collected sarcoma patient samples. We are particularly interested in the interplay between tumor cells and immune response, and what role the immune microenvironment plays in recurrent and metastatic disease. Understanding the molecular basis of tumor evolution after standard therapy could result in rapid clinical translation of novel therapies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are part of a multi-disciplinary team of cancer researchers filled with passionate and determined individuals who will provide the successful candidate with a stimulating and conducive environment to participate and grow as a scientist. The research is conducted at the University of Calgary, in close collaboration with local and international scientists and clinicians, and thus will also provide the successful candidate with opportunities to learn from a large network of talented professionals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The PDF will lead integrative analyses of multi-dimensional cancer genomics data from patient samples with rich clinical annotations, and from mouse models of the disease. The candidate will use statistical and machine learning approaches to interpret data (genomic/proteomic and spatial transcriptome datasets) in the context of tumour evolution, with the aim of understanding the dynamics of tumour growth, relapse, metastases and progression. The PDF will design and carry out experiments and lead the writing of scientific manuscripts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>PhD with training in bioinformatics, computer science, statistics or cell biology</li>
  <li>Experience working in a Unix environment (shell scripting, command-line tools)</li>
  <li>Experience conducting large-scale data analyses (genomic/multi-omic)</li>
  <li>Expertise with machine-learning methods, and statistical analyses using R</li>
  <li>Understanding of cancer cell biology or immunology is highly desirable</li>
  <li>Track record of creativity in developing analytic strategies</li>
  <li>Evidence of scientific accomplishment via peer-reviewed publications</li>
  <li>Highly motivated with excellent organizational, problem-solving and communication skills (verbal and written)</li>
</ul>
