<h2 id="research-overview">Research Overview</h2>
<p>The Morrissy Lab is a combined research group in Translational Cancer Genomics.</p>

<p>Tumor evolution is a continuing process of re-iterating genetic and epigenetic diversification followed by clonal expansion and selection, occurring in the adaptive landscape of tumor microenvironments. These dynamics yield heterogeneous clonal lineages that underpin cancerâ€™s ability to progress, metastasize, and ultimately become resistant to treatment.  Intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is thus a formidable barrier to therapeutic success, and significant efforts are ongoing to understand the dynamics, constraints, and contingencies of this ongoing evolutionary process.  In my lab, we focus on the extent and clinical implications of ITH, measuring and modelling tumor evolution, and approaches for therapeutic strategies that consider and incorporate this key aspect of tumor biology.</p>

<p>The Morrissy Lab is an interdisciplinary <a href="/team/">team</a> of bioinformaticians, computer scientists, and software engineers. Each member of the lab is trained to use computational biology approaches to address research questions relating to cancer biology and precision cancer medicine.</p>
